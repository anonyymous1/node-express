# node-express

Notes:

## Creating Node
1. You go to your `Github` and create a `Repo`.
2. Once you create that `Repo` go into your terminals to `clone` it locally.
3. Once you `clone` you repo.
4. Be sure to go into your `repo folder` to start the process.
5. Two options you have are `npm init` which will ask you details on your project if you want to be more descriptive, or `npm init -y` which will default all the settings to yes and blank.
Questions it will ask for `npm init`: ( It will also show you what is default if you hit enter. )
```text
{
  "name":
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description":
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": 
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": 
  },
  "author": 
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": 
  },
  "homepage":
}
```
6. If you did the previous steps correctly, you should be able to `ls` to see you now have a `package.json` file along with you `README.md` file.
7. To check what is in the `package.json` file, type in `cat package.json` in your terminal. This will display the content.
8. Be sure to check what you `"main"`. Your `.js` file mus have that same name.
9. Now if you try to write `code` that will usually show up in the console, you can simple type `node index.js` (name if your .js file) and it will show in your terminal.
10. Go ahead and type in `console.log('Hello')` into your `index.js`. Then in your terminal type `node index.js`.

Good Job! You did it!

## Importing Exporting

When creating functions in other `.js` files, you must be sure to export them to be used outside that file. In this case my `.js` file is called `myModule.js`
For example:
```js
const beBasic = () => "That's so fetch!";

function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

function subtract (num1, num2) {
    return num2 - num1;
}

module.exports = { // functions you want to export go here.
    beBasic, 
    add, 
    subtract
}
```

Now when called in other `.js` files, you can use the following to use.
```js
const {add, subtract, beBasic} = require ('./myModule') //This line pulls the functions from our other .js file (myModule.js)

let name = 'Ruben Cedeno';
console.log(name);

function printName (person) {
    return `hello, ${person}`;
}

console.log(printName(name));
console.log(beBasic());
console.log(add(5,50));
console.log(subtract(10,20));
```
### Now once again check your terminal using node. You're Done!

## Creating .gitIgnore file
1. First thing you want to do it make sure you are in the correct `repo` in your terminal.
2. Next you want to type `touch .gitIgnore` make sure you add the "." as this wont work with out it.
3. Once you created that file go ahead and open it using the terminal by typing `code .`.
4. In here you want too type in all the first and folders that you want hidden. Be sure to spell the file name exactly how they are spelled, otherwise it will not work.
